# 🪖 Military Hand Signal Recognition using TinyML

## Project Overview

This project presents an efficient embedded vision approach for recognizing a limited set of military hand signals using a lightweight deep learning model optimized for deployment on resource-constrained devices.

The model is trained using transfer learning with MobileNetV2 and converted to TensorFlow Lite (INT8) for embedded deployment.
