# 🪖 Military Hand Signal Recognition using TinyML

## Project Overview

This project presents an efficient embedded vision approach for recognizing a limited set of military hand signals using a lightweight deep learning model optimized for deployment on resource-constrained devices.

The model is trained using transfer learning with MobileNetV2 and converted to TensorFlow Lite (INT8) for embedded deployment.

## Objectives

- Design a lightweight CNN-based classifier

- Analyze training convergence and generalization

- Apply fine-tuning techniques

- Optimize model using INT8 quantization

- Evaluate deployment feasibility on embedded systems
